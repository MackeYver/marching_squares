### Disclaimer
- No part of the code in this project should be considered as a good example in any shape or form
- If you're looking for learning resources you probably should look elsewhere


### My goals
- Try out various coding styles and libraries (e.g. using the standard library vs not using the standard library)
- Create a small, but cool, project that could be finished in a reasonable time frame
- Get some experience in optimizing algorithms and code
- Create a (somewhat) efficient implementation of the marching squares algorithm


### Dev. log.
Development will be documented in txt files -- in order to keep it simple and to the point -- which will be saved in the notes directory.
