#Viewport
--------
D3d10_VIEWPORT is easy to setup and use: D3D10Device->SetViewports(n, *viewports); Doesn't 
affect the ClearRenderTargetView, but that does make a lot of sense, I guess that it will 
only affect the output from the geometry stage/shader.

Today I will take start with creating a depth and a stencil buffer followed by a closer 
look at shaders. I will hopefully be able to render a triangle before the day is over.



##Sidequest
----------
But first, depth and stencil buffers.
  Looking into the creation of said buffers I found two different verions of the structs
describing 2d textures:
  CD3D10_TEXTURE2D_DESC and D3D10_TEXTURE2D_DESC.
I found it to be a bit weird to be honest, the CD3D10 seems to inherit from the D3D10_ 
struct; not sure of why. Perhaps for sake of convenience? It seem to have a couple
of constructors and a destructor, but it's unclear what the destructor does -- the
help-page seems to be a bit broken.

Using the D3D10_DEPTH_STENCIL_VIEW_DESC, I needed to set the Texture2D.MipSlice = 0. 
The documentation for D3D10_DEPTH_STENCIL_VIEW_DESC is a bit.. lacking. In general, 
it seems to me that the quality of the DirectX 10 documentation is low, especially in
comparison to DirectX 11 -- which seems to be almost decent.

The debug information is kind of cool, ReportLiveObjects() reminded me that I also need
to release all the resources used in connection with the depth and stencil stuff.
  When updating the cleanup code, I noted that in the documentation about DepthStencilState,
the following is stated:
  "The method will not hold a reference to the interfaces passed in. For that reason, 
  applications should be careful not to release an interface currently in use by the device."
Due to this, I first call Device->OMSetDepthStencilState(nullptr, 1) in order to tell
the device to not use the DepthStencilState. First after that, I release the state.

Phew, it is a lot of work to setup DirectX!
