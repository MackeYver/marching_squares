Goal of today:
1. Improve the structure of the measurement
2. Implement the c style version of the algorithm



## Sidequest 1: Bugs
------------------
Well, turns out that some of the DirectX objects were not released in the correct order,
which caused it to throw some exceptions... Fixed now! (D'oh!)

Also related, the bug reported in note 2019-01-20.txt: turns out that I were releasing the
RenderTargetView twice for some reason, so the underflow of the refcount was on the
renderview not on the swap chain. (D'oh #2!)

Since I almost always closed the program via Visual Studio, the DirectX clean-up code never
ran... (D'oh #3!).



## 1. Improve the structure of the measurements
---------------------------------------------
A total redesign of the testing structure. Now it will output the data into text files and
I'll try to make into a sensible csv format which I can easily analyse in a spreadsheet.
