#Goals of the day (O = optional)
-------------------------------
1. Render the different layers in different colours (updating the constant buffer)
2. Render a grid to display the cell sizes
O. Write cell heights (Text rendering)



##1. Render the different levels in different colours
---------------------------------------------------
In order to change the colour of the lines per level, I need to supply the Pixel shader with the 
colour that should be used. In order to do this I need to do two things:
1. Bind the constant buffer to the Pixel Shader as well
2. Make the constant buffer dynamic, i.e. changing:
   a) the usage to D3D10_USAGE_DYNAMICS
   b) the CPUAccessFlags to D3D10_CPU_ACCESS_WRITE

So I got the data uploaded to the shaders for each frame, turns out that I didn't need to set 
the buffer as dynamic or change the CPUAccessFlags. I used UpdateSubresource which must be used 
on an un-mapped resource.

However, since the window is not of the correct size (see earlier notes), it looks like Windows 
scales the image. This causes the lines to look like they are not connected to each other. 
Resizing the window (the buffers do not change sizes) results in that the lines connect in that 
resulting scaled up image.
I need to check why the window is of the wrong size since the scaling is now causing problems.



##Sidequest -- figuring out why the window is of the wrong size
-------------------------------------------------------------
Stepping through the code and looking at the results from AdjustRect I could see that the size 
of the Rect didn't change at all (I expected it to change after the call to AdjustRect). 
I also saw that I didn't use the same styles in the CreateWindow as in the AdjustRect. But the 
big problem was that I did something stupid... 
I confused the WindowClass style with the Window style, i.e. CS_VREDRAW with WS_ stuff. 
Changing this and making sure that I used the same style everywhere fixed the problem entirely. 
The window is now of correct size (checked a screenshot in MSPaint) and all the lines connects.
Sidequest complete!



##2. Render a grid
----------------
Nothing really interesting or troublesome with this. The grid renders correctly (I'm starting
to get a hang on this now). The only issue to solve is that the grid renders at z = 0.0 which
is the same as the actually lines. Since I do have depth testing enabled, the lines that 
intersects with the grid is not being rendered. I will add a z variable to the constant
buffer.
Apparently, the size of the constant buffer must be a multiple of 16 bytes; I added a v3 as 
padding in order to make the ShaderConstant struct be 96 bytes. I know this as DirectX gave 
that as an error message, it was a precise and clear error message. Thank you DirectX!



##3. Text rendering
-----------------
I will use DirectWrite, mainly because I want to learn how to use it. I'm not sure of how well 
it will interact with DirectX 10, but judging by the documentation it is designed to interact
with any kind of rendering API. We'll see. (The documentation also reveals that it will most
likely be as painful to setup as DirectX).

Yeah, apparently DirectWrite uses Direct2D which requires DirectX 10.1. So either change to
use 10.1 or use some other text rendering API/technique. My reasons to not use 10.1 were not
super well grounded (see note from 2018-12-16), but it may be possible that some users have
DirectX 10 capable hardware that does not support 10.1.
But, I couldn't use pixel format BGRA since that seemed to require 10.1 so I might as well 
change to use 10.1, then I would also get BGRA support.



##Sidequest -- change to DirectX 10.1
-----------------------------------
Added the factories and the all the other stuff that's needed in order to setup anything
DirectX related.
Discovered that DirectX gave a warning for live objects; I forgot to call release on some-
thing. Took me a while to figure out what it was (the debug message from DirectX was not
helpful at all). Turns out that it was the vertexbuffer from point 2 above...
"Nothing really interersting or troublesome with this", yeah right! Fixed it.
