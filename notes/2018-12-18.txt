I didn't reach my goal yesterday so that goal will be remain today: render a triangle on the screen.

I have looked into compiling shaders and how to do that. I will start with very simple shaders and
the simplest of simple workflows: writing the shader into a String literal and compile that. The
logical solution for the future would be to setup a offline rendering workflow using FXC.exe. It
seems to be quite easy actually (famous last words). But that is for later, now: stringified shaders!

[some time later...]
Now I have written, compiled and created the shaders. Nothing troublesome here really, actually not
weird or complicated at all. Finally, let the rendering commence!

Turns out that I was wrong... I need to define and set a vertex layout first, jösses -- it is a lot
of work to initialize DirectX.



##Troubleshooting graphics
------------------------
Well, I got everything to compile and I am -- probably -- setting everything that needs setting, 
but alas, the program rendered no triangle! Rendering paused, troubleshooting commenced...

I checked my vertices, do they have the wrong winding? Unverified sources tells me that the default
winding in DirectX is clockwise, but changing into that has no effect.

The Graphics Debugger in Visual Studio seems to be not all bad, I just need to set some flags when
I compile the shaders.
