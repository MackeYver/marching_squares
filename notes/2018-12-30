#Goals of the day (O = optional)
-------------------------------
1. Render the different layers in different colours (updating the constant buffer)
2. Render a grid to display the cell sizes
O. Write cell heights (Text rendering)



##1. Render the different levels in different colours
---------------------------------------------------
In order to change the colour of the lines per level, I need to supply the Pixel shader with the 
colour that should be used. In order to do this I need to do two things:
1. Bind the constant buffer to the Pixel Shader as well
2. Make the constant buffer dynamic, i.e. changing:
   a) the usage to D3D10_USAGE_DYNAMICS
   b) the CPUAccessFlags to D3D10_CPU_ACCESS_WRITE

So I got the data uploaded to the shaders for each frame, turns out that I didn't need to create 
the buffer as dynamic or change the CPUAccessFlags. I used UpdateSubresource which must be used 
on an un-mapped resource.

However, since the window is not of the correct size (see earlier notes), it looks like Windows 
scales the image. This causes the lines to look like they are not connected to each other. 
Resizing the window (the buffers do not change sizes) results in that the lines connect in that 
resulting scaled up image.
I need to check why the window is of the wrong size since the scaling is now causing problems.



##Sidequest -- figuring out why the window is of the wrong size
-------------------------------------------------------------
Stepping through the code and looking at the results from AdjustRect I could see that the size 
of the Rect didn't change at all (I expected it to change after the call to AdjustRect). 
I also saw that I didn't use the same styles in the CreateWindow as in the AdjustRect. But the 
big problem was that I did something stupid... 
I confused the WindowClass style with the Window style, i.e. CS_VREDRAW with WS_ stuff. 
Changing this and making sure that I used the same styles everywhere fixed the problem entirely. 
The window is now of correct size (checked a screenshot in MSPaint) and all the lines connects.
Sidequest complete!


##2. Render a grid
