#Goals for today:

1. Get a working version of MergeLines (or MergeVertices?) up and running


##Sidequest -- getting a console to view output from printf
---------------------------------------------------------
I started the day with setting up a console and redirecting the stdout to it. It was actually
really simple to do so, just to use AllocConsole/FreeConsole and redirecting the output with
a call: freopen_s(FILE, "CONOUT$", "w", stdout);
This way I can print debug stuff from files wich do not have access to Windows stuff (oop_stl
for instance).
