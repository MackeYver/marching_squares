#Working on initializing DirectX 10
----------------------------------

This notes are written as I go along so they are hastily put together. Spelling
and grammar will probably be of low quality -- you have my sincerest apologies!

Got an error when creating the SwapChain:
    HRESULT Result = CreateDXGIFactory(__uuidof(IDXGIFactory), (void**)(&Factory));
    if (Result != S_OK)
    {
        // TODO(Marcus): Add better error handling
        OutputDebugString(L"Failed to create DXGIFactory!\n");
        return 0;
    }
        
    Result = Factory->CreateSwapChain(D3DDevice, &SwapChainDesc, &SwapChain);
    if (Result != S_OK)
    {
        // TODO(Marcus): Add better error handling
        OutputDebugString(L"Failed to create the swap chain!\n");
        return 0;
    }
            
The error code I received was E_INVALIDARG which seems to indicate that I'm supplying an invalid
parameter to the CreateFactory. But checking the parameters I supplied, I didn't find any obvious
error. In order to get more information about the error I set the flag D3D10_CREATE_DEVICE_DEBUG
when creating the D3D10 device (only in the debug build, I used #ifdef to make sure of this).
  This resulted in that I found out that "the device doesn't support DXGI_FORMAT_B8G8R8A8_UNORM"
which seems weird due to that my GPU is of a rather new model. I recalled that the documentation
mentioned something about BGRA support, and I totally forgot that I commented on this earlier
(thanks brain).
I tried to add the flag D3D10_CREATE_DEVICE_BGRA_SUPPORT to the creation of the D3D device, but it
didn't help. Perhaps I need to create a D3D 10.1 device after all? Unfortunately it doesn't seem
like I can safely assume that a user's hardware that support DX10 also supports DX10.1.
Options:
  1. Use DX 10.1
    - This will decrease the user-base but I don't know by how much

  2. Switch to DX 11
    - According to Steam's Hardware survey, this will decrease the user base with ~4 percentage
      points.

  3. Check if the hardware support BGRA and if not, use another format
     - Added complexity (not much but still more complex than before)

  4. Use another format (RGBA)
     - No added complexity but potentially degrading performance?

The reason for me trying to use BGRA is that it seems like this is the format used by Windows?
Several sources mention this but I haven't confirmed this yet.

For now I chose option #4, I will use RGBA format instead. I will revisit this if necessary.



#Un-released objects
-------------------
Checking the debug output after the program closes lead me to believe that we have a lot of
objects that are not released properly. In order to get better information about what's going
on, I decided to use ReportLiveObjects(). This is not available by default, unless you are
building a Windows 8 app of some sort -- which we are not doing. So, I use GetProcAddress
in order to get the address of the needed function:
        HMODULE hModule = GetModuleHandleA("Dxgidebug.dll");
        if (!hModule) {
            OutputDebugString(L"Failed to get module handle to Dxgidebug.dll\n");
            return 1;
        }
        
        typedef HRESULT (*GETDEBUGINTERFACE)(REFIID, void **);
        GETDEBUGINTERFACE GetDebugInterface;
        GetDebugInterface = (GETDEBUGINTERFACE)GetProcAddress(hModule, "DXGIGetDebugInterface");
        
        HRESULT Result = GetDebugInterface(__uuidof(IDXGIDebug), (void **)&DebugInterface);
        if (Result != S_OK)
        {
            // TODO(Marcus): Add better error handling
            OutputDebugString(L"Failed to get the debug interface!\n");
            return 1;
        }

  Turns out that all that was needed was to also release the backbuffer (which I apparently
forgot to do)...
Doing so, led to ReportLiveObjects didn't print anything and there is no message after the
end of the program.



#A scale and a manifest
----------------------
Looking closely at the rendered window -- basically taking a screenshot and inspecting it mspaint,
I could see that the size of window was wrong. I'm developing on a 4k monitor (the text rendering
is amazing) and I set Windows to scale GUI and text by 150%. Since I set the size to be 1024x1024, 
I expected the window's client area to have a size of 1024. But it was 50% bigger, which seemed to 
indicate that it was indeed scaled.
  Looking at the size of the buffer (1024x1024), and the reported size of the window (1024x1024),
I suspected that Windows will be scaling when blitting to the window; i.e. the rendered content will
probably be stretched.

Reading through the documentation, looking for some way to prevent Windows from scaling the client
area, I stumbled upon references to "the manifest file". I don't believe that I've heard about them
before this, so that was interesting. It was a very long time since I last did any development on
Windows. Apparently, a manifest file contains information about the application and can be used in
some different ways, one way is to embed the file in the exe.

I chose to embed a hacked together manifest file into the exe file. I changed my build.bat so that
the linker didn't produce any manifest file (/MANIFEST:NO, but it seemed like it actually didn't
produce a manifest earlier either) and added a post-build step in that bat file.
  mt.exe -manifest "path_to_manifest_file" -outputresource:"path_to_exe"

The manifest file itself is a bit of a "Frankenstein's manifest file"; I duct-taped it together using
msdn and some internet searches. The important parts were:
  <asmv3:application xmlns:asmv3="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v3">
    <asmv3:windowsSettings xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/SMI/2005/WindowsSettings">
      <dpiAwareness xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/SMI/2016/WindowsSettings">system</dpiAwareness>
      <dpiAware>True</dpiAware>
    </asmv3:windowsSettings>
  </asmv3:application>

To verify the result in another way as well, I stepped through the code and checked which resolution
Windows reported with <dpiAware> and without. I used:
  GetSystemMetrics(SM_CXSCREEN);
With <dpiAware> I got the correct resolution, 4k -- but without it I got other values which verifies
that it worked. Yay!

Well, now the window actually seems to be a bit small..? Like, the width is somewhere around 1004 instead
of 1024. I need to investigate this some more, but that will have to wait for another day.
