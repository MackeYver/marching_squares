Goal of the day:
1. Pull out the DirectX code into its own thing
2. Implement some way of measuring performance (RTSCD)



##1. Pull out the DirectX code into its own thing
-----------------------------------------------
We want to start profiling and measuring performance of the implementation and it seems
lika a good idea to structure it so that it's easy to run the implementaiton several 
times in a row but with different inputs. Pulling out the DirectX code is a good start.
