(This day we'll continue on the goals set yesterday).

Goal of the day:
1. Pull out the DirectX code into its own thing
2. Implement some way of measuring performance (RTSCD)



##1. Pull out the DirectX code into its own thing
-----------------------------------------------
Done! Not most of the DirectX code is pulled out into its own thing, we could probably take it
even further (next step would probably be to use a platform agnostic frontend and a platform
specific backend), but this we'll do for now.

Also changed the program so that it runs the algorithm on all the data, for now we have only
five sets of data. The use can change which of the results that gets rendered to the screen by
pressing the I key.



##SideQuest - Ref count underflow in the swap chain
-------------------------------------------------
See the note from yesterday to see the full description of this bug.
