Still working on the version that uses OOP and the standard library. Changed from using a pointer to a float array
to using a std::vector owned by the class. Will probably go all-in on c++ and make it into a template class (in
order to support data as both float and int).

Added the capability to load data from a text file. Currently only supporting a text file with values seperated by
a space. Will maybe enchance this and support a better format in the future. It will also be handled by the class
itself rather than be done outside as it is now.

Goals:
- Load data from a file or from an in-memory POD array or std::vector
- Support float and int (template?) 


Re-structured the oop_std files in order to make them easier to read. Also implemented the copy-constructor and
the assignment operator to the _SDL class ("rule of three").
Created a test .txt file to use for testing.

Reading data from files resulted in a size that was one greater than expected. Turns out there was a bug in the
loop that read data from the file and pushed it to the vector. The file was not put in eof state until the
program tried to read past the eof, thus we were adding the last data twice. This since the feof(file) was in the
while statement and the adding vector inside the brackets, causing us to read and fail but still add to the
vector. An if statement just before we add data solved the problem:
  if (feof(file))  break;

Finally were able to run the test on the test data (volcano dataset) and it worked -- cool. (See image #1).
However, it looks like it has been rotated in comparison to images from the source. Probably the data in the file
that is saved differently than what I thought.
