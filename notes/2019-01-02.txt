Goal: the same as the other day: get some text rendered. In other words: debug the code.


I did check the GPU calls via the Visual Studio's GPU debugger, but I saw no draw calls related 
to Direct2D or DirectWrite as far as I could tell. So it seem like it there are no draw calls 
being generated? I will try to get some debugging information from Direct2D or DirectWrite.
What worries me a bit for the moment is that I migh be mixing different version with each other,
perhaps this is no good?

Looking the HRESULT from the EndDraw() call, I could see that some object was not in a valid
state. But which object? Enabling debug messages from Direct2D turned out to be simple enough:
just supply a D2D1_FACTORY_OPTIONS to the CreateFactory function. I set the debug level to be
xxx_WARNING_xxx; this triggered a breakpoint at the EndDraw() with a message that tells me that
the render target was NULL at the time of the draw call. So, seems like I didn't set the target
properly (or at all?).

And hey! DeviceContext->SetTarget was all the was missing! Yay, text rendering is now working!
