Goal of today:
1. Implement the c style version of the algorithm (continuing from previous days)



## Sidequest 1: Bugs
------------------
I change the build.bat in order to also build a fast debug build, or rather, compile the 
code with optimization O2 but also with some debug options (/Zi). This caused the program
to always hit a breakpoint or throw an exception in random code at exit. I checked all my
code, in particular the DirectX cleanup but all seemed fine. I made sure that every object
was properly released -- in a correct order -- but that didn't helpt at all.
  Then I realised that I did use debugging features from DirectX. Perhaps some of the debug
code in the DirectX libraries changed/compiled out when I compiled with O2? If I removed
the DDEBUG as a build options (effectually removing the use of the DirectX debug features)
it exited without any arbitrary errors. Fixed!
  Hyopthesis: 
    - debug features of DirectX will be compiled out if compiled as a non-optimized build.



## 1. Implement the c style version of the algorithm
--------------------------------------------------
I have cheated a bit and opted to use Sean Barett's stretchy buffer implementation. I could
implement it myself but that will have to wait for later. The same will be true for the
implementation of a hash-table.
